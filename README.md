# Sales-and-Market-share-analysis

Project Title: Sales and Market Share Analysis for VanArsdel Electronics

## Client Background:

VanArsdel, a manufacturer of high-end electronic products for both personal and professional use, sought to understand its sales performance and market share in three key markets. To benchmark against competitors, VanArsdel partnered with a third-party marketing firm to gather anonymized industry sales data. This analysis, typical for a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), aimed to provide insights into both internal product performance and external competitive positioning.

## Problem Statement:

The primary objective of this project was to analyze VanArsdel's sales data alongside industry market data to:
- Determine VanArsdel's market share in each target market.
- Identify top-performing products and regions.
- Uncover trends in sales and market share over time.
- Provide actionable insights to inform marketing and sales strategies."

## Data Sources and Preparation:

The data for this analysis was provided in an Excel workbook containing:
VanArsdel's sales data (product, date, geography, sales figures).
Anonymized industry sales data.
Product and geographical dimension tables.
Data preparation involved:

2. Cleaning and transforming data to ensure consistency and accuracy (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing date formats). <img width="1199" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010bb92b-fe52-44fa-bd14-29d25c192b8a" />

3. Creating relationships between tables to build a robust data model. ![Screenshot 2025-03-04 203652 m](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70e037eb-45bc-47c7-8890-aae6c5afb301)

   


## Analytical Techniques and Methodology:

The analysis was conducted using Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service. Key techniques included:
Calculating market share using DAX measures.
Creating time series charts to visualize sales and market share trends.
Developing interactive dashboards to explore product and regional performance.
Utilizing Power Query for data transformation and loading (ETL).
Describe the use of specific DAX functions.
Explain the logic behind the Data model.
The document was structured in a table format with step by step instructions on the left, and screenshots on the right. This was designed to be easily followed by the end user."

## Key Findings and Visualizations:

Key findings included:
